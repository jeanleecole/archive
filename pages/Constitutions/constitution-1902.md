The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore. 
“Formed to encourage exact and noble thinking among our women; hoping to prove that added strength will cultivate larger grace of speech and manner, keener instincts of pure womanhood, a deeper appreciation of the precious opportunities of the home life, with a truer comprehension of its responsibilities- a broader, and not less loving and believing heart.”

The Twelfth Night Festival
Or
(Old Christmas)

Instituted in
The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore,
January 6th, 1902

By
The President
Mrs. John C. Wrenshall

“Led by the star, we come, as did those of ancient days, the music of the far away time for us, as it was for the shepherds upon the hills, and the three kings of the Orient, prototypes of the phases of life in the host ever moving onward, together, in the harmony of immortal souls led by the star.

Down through the ages the host has come, following the star with songs of joy and all the innocent mirth of the season, the nations of the civilized world uniting in keeping ‘Merrie Christmas’.... Memories tender and true are a part of Christmas and as we hold dear and follow the old customs, we emulate the example of the folk that made them, and come together

“To keep our Twelfth Night.”

Excerpts from a Twelfth Night address by Mrs. John C. Wrenshall.[^back]
