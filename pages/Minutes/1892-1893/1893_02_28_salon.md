## 22nd Salon. W.L.C. [February 28th, 1893], at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets.

Being our first meeting in our new quarters, this Salon partook of the nature of a more general Reception than usual, as invitations were sent to a number of our friends, both ladies and gentlemen to be present.

Though several of the distinguished expected guests did not arrive, the Secretary has been assured that the meeting was one of great social enjoyment.
