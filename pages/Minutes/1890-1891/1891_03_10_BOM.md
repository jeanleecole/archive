## Board Meeting--March 10th 1891
[Book I, MS 988, Box 3, p. 47]

An informal meeting of the Board of Management W.L.C. was held at 861 Garden Street, on Tuesday afternoon, March 10th, after the general meeting of the Club.

The name of Mrs. [Laura] Atkinson was added to the Committee of resolutions on the death of Mrs. Chapman [Anne Mary] Coleman, non-resident member. The other members of the Committee are Mrs. Franklin [Christine Ladd-Franklin], Mrs. [Caroline Canfield] Bullock and Miss [Jane] Zacharias. Mrs. [Henry] Stockbridge suggested that the names of the Committee might be mentioned to the friends of the deceased, and Mrs. Smith thought the resolutions themselves should be signed by the President and Secretary.

Adjourned.

Eliza Ridgely 
Secretary
