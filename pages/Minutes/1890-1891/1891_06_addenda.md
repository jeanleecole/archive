## Resolutions of Regret on the Death of Mrs. Mary Spear Tiernan
## January 13th 1891.

In the bright hours of the New Year that has come to us so full of hope and promise, we are called to stand still and hushed, in the presence of that great power which holds in its hand and guides into the “silent land” so much that is precious, so much that once made the beauty and gladness of life. To-day, only a short time before the hour appointed for the assembling of the Club came the unexpected and sad tidings of the going away from our midst of Mrs. Mary Spear Tiernan, one of the founders of the Woman’s Literary Club--one of its brightest members--one most suggestive and original in modes of thought, most alert to all that might advance the interests of our Association.

At one o’clock this morning, after an illness of brief duration, she passed into the thitherland, that, in the glory of an eternal morn, lies beyond human vision.

Our loss is indeed grievous and carries sorrow to every member of the Club who knew her only as a spirited writer, a ready speaker, quick and interesting in argument, courteous and friendly to her co-workers.

But to those, who in the close association of years,

[81]

held knowledge of her aspirations, her earnest endeavors for excellence, her fund of humor and genial nature, the loss of Mrs. Tiernan is indeed a bereavement--a regret keen and enduring.

She has gone in the fullness of her powers, but as we feel sure, not before her work was finished--She has gone--and in the long days when she shall walk no more among us, all kindly and gentle memories will cluster about her name, which today and tomorrow, as time moves on, will be to us as a sweet song that is sung, as a chord lost from life’s harmonies, as a ray of light gathered back to its source--for “Death is not death--what seems so, is _transition_."

(This quotation from Longfellow was suggested by Mrs. [Elizabeth Turner] Graham as resolution, and so adopted.)

## Resolutions of Regret on the Death of Mrs. Ann Mary Coleman (Mrs. Chapman [Anne Mary] Coleman)
## 1891.

A Committee of the Woman’s Club of Baltimore consisting of Mrs. [Laura] Atkinson, Mrs. [Caroline Canfield] Bullock, Miss [Jane] Zacharias and Mrs. Franklin [Christine Ladd-Franklin], having been appointed to take action upon the death of Mrs. Ann Mary Coleman, drew up the following resolutions:--

Whereas: A notice of the death of Mrs. Ann Mary Coleman, a member of the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, forwarded to us from Louisville, Kentucky, occasions us deep sorrow and regret;

And whereas: Mrs. Coleman was well and most appreciatively known and valued in Baltimore, and those of us whose privilege it was to be among her friends had frequent opportunity to witness the noble traits of her character as well as to admire her remarkable and vigorous intellect;

Resolved: that we sincerely regret her death, and that we would convey to her bereaved family our sympathy for their inestimable loss and our hope for their consolation through the evidence of the strong faith which characterized her life.

Resolved: that a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to the family of our lamented friend, Mrs. Ann Mary Coleman.
