## 26th Salon. October 3rd 1893.

The 26th Salon of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore, was held on Tuesday, October 3rd, 1893, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral streets, being the opening meeting of the Club year 1893 & 1894. Miss [Emma Fenwick] Brent, the President, called the meeting to order. The Recording Secretary read the Minutes of the three last meetings of the past Club year, including those of the annual election on May 23rd and May 27th and that of the closing Salon of May 30th 1893.

The Minutes were adopted. We were then given the opening address of the President.

She greeted us in coming together again, with very much to encourage us. There have been no losses by death in our numbers,--we can congratulate ourselves on the high position our Club has gained before the eyes of the community as a Literary centre; and feel that we have opportunities for increasing our

[135]

literary work, for careful study and mental advancement. We were reminded that we are living in a great and splendid age,--also that we live among law-abiding people, that the best basis of law is love; and that we are united in the love of learning. She quoted some eloquent words that were said in Ancient Egypt about the love of knowledge. She spoke of the learning of the early Greeks, of their power of reasoning from causes to effects,-- & from effects to causes, of their ethics, logic, and geometry, of the study of the characteristics of that great people that can be made from their literature. She quoted from Macaulay "That no external advantage is to be compared with that purification of the intellectual eye which gives us to contemplate the infinite wealth of the mental world; all the hoarded treasures of the primeval dynasties, all the shapeless ore of the yet unexplored mines."

In the spirit of these words, let us again take up our literary work,--like the old Greeks[--] to make the best of ourselves.

Our President went on to speak of all that we hope for in the coming year. That the work of our Committee on Economics may be built up like the Greek temple in straight and faultless lines. That in Modern Philanthropy we may be able to relieve human suffering, especially as women can, the sufferings of little children, the children of Mrs. [Elizabeth Barrett] Browning's poem, who "Know the grief of man

[136]

without his wisdom,["] who "sink in man's despair without its calm," "are martyrs by the pang without the palm."[^browning]

[^browning]: Paraphrased lines from "The Cry of the Children," by Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1843).

Our Committee on Education has this noble work also. Our President hoped that our Committee on Art may do some of the most refining work God has given to be done,--for Art is the materialization of poetry, the exemplification of the progress of man, of the divine hand guiding the hand of the mortal.

Women are fitted to be artists in their perception of color, and of harmoniousness. In their attention to children and sick people, they see nature effectively.

That from our Committee on the Authors and Artists of Maryland, Authors and Artists may go out to fill the ranks of the representatives of our own state. That our studies in Archeology may be full of interest, and full of history in their researches into the Antiquities of Egypt, Italy, Greece and other lands.

Miss Brent spoke of a word used by Professor [Rodolfo] Lanciani in one of his lectures in Baltimore. Some one understood him to speak of a courier in the study of Archeology. Another one of his auditors thought he had said a curio, which raised a laugh. Another one however believed he had said a Cuvier, because [Georges] Cuvier, the Naturalist, was said to be able to reconstruct an

[137]

extinct animal from a single fossil bone.

Our President thought that some one of our members might in this sense, be a Cuvier in Archeology. She hoped that our Committee on Ancient and Medieval Poetry would bring us those works so full of emotion and intelligence, that we may truly feel the influence of the great minds of former days.

That our chairman of the Committee on Modern Poetry, Miss [Lizette Woodworth] Reese, may give us the songs of the lark, and the sunrise, of the music and light of the present and of the future. That our Committee on Essays and Essayists may show us how well these subjects can be treated arousing even intenser and higher interest than ever before.

That our Committee on Fiction may show us how truth can be taught by fiction, and even corrected by its influence.

That our Committee on Unwritten History may develope the resources of those unworked, or imperfectly worked fields, both North and South, which shall yield us rich returns. That our Committee on Translations shall venture into Spain and Provence, France, Italy and Germany, and less known regions to bring back new and old gems of literature, and give them to us in our own tongue.

Charles the fifth is reported to have said, that by so many languages as a man knows, so many times is he a man.

[138]

We may not each of us be many women, but we can add to the intellectual riches of many fellow women, and of many home circles.

That our Committee on Current Criticism may continue its excellent work of keeping in touch with the literature of our own times, our own passing days.

The Committee of the Exact Study of the English Languages, has a great work before it.

Our President spoke of the confusion of tongues on the plain of Shinar, when the human race seemed hopelessly dispersed over the world, never to be re-united.[^babel] But expansive steam has been brought under rule, and made to do its work.
[^babel]: The Tower of Babel (Gen. 10-11) was built on the plain of Shinar in Babylonia.

She quoted what James Russell Lowell said in the good mental discipline of the study of modern languages.

Also his saying that "Literature has escaped the doom of Shinar, and still everywhere speaks in the universal tongue of civilized man."[^Lowell]
[^Lowell]: James Russell Lowell, Presidential Address, Modern Language Association, 1889; reprinted in _PMLA_ 115.7: 1734-1738. The MLA was founded in 1883 to promote the "academic and scientific study" of so-called modern languages, in contradistinction to the ancient languages of Greek and Latin.

In conclusion, our President thought we could go forward with enthusiasm, keeping our motto "Woman's Words" and taking for our watchword "Onward."

Mrs. [Maria W.] Miller now gave us an article on Louise [Louisa] May Alcott. She introduced her subject by speaking of our sometimes passing by the tall and highly colored flowers in a garden, to find the small

[139]

fragrant blossoms that we love for the true pleasure they give us. She spoke of the noble womanly life of one to whom many of us, old and young have cause for gratitude.

Louise May Alcott, though belonging by ancestry and residence more to Massachusetts than to any other state, was born in Germantown Pennsylvania in 1832. Her father failed in keeping school there, and went back to Boston. This father was the well-known A. Bronson Alcott of whom Hawthorne in 1841 speaks as "a transcendental visitor to Brooke Farm.["]

He was an unsuccessful man in worldly affairs, but his unworldliness was loved, honored and revered by his family and friends.

The family were poor in money; they were we are told a pathetic family.

Mrs. Miller described the family life so charmingly recorded in "Little Women" and other stories and sketches, and in the testimony of eyewitnesses in Concord. Then[,] Hawthorne was their next door neighbor, and Emerson as we were told their good genius in what has been called the genial Concord which existed from 1859 to 1865 or thereabouts. "To warm the eight cold feet on the carpet at home." Louisa began as we were told, to launch ships on the Atlantic, and to write books;, and long before her death, made herself and her family independent.

In the War, she went to

[140]

work in the hospitals, though her mother said she should feel helpless without Louisa and her father, that he was giving up his only son. But then her physical strength broke down.[^HSketches] We were told of her struggles and sacrifices,--that she might have married, but would not. Also that she proposed to omit marriage from the lives of some of her heroines, but was told by her publishers that the public would demand it.

[^HSketches]: Alcott related these experiences in her memoir _Hospital Sketches_ (1863).

After speaking of Miss Alcott's various writings, Mrs. Miller gave the tribute of her own gratitude to this author. She spoke of reading aloud to her own children; of her pleasure in finding books to read to them of which they approved as highly as she did. When her doors were closed by the measles they were yet opened to "Eight Cousins" and other gay and good young company.[^8Cousins]

[^8Cousins]: Alcott's novel _Eight Cousins_ was published in 1875.

To the question whether Miss Alcott's books would live, Mrs. Miller answered: "Only time will show." But she asked if it is not much to have given true and wide spread pleasure--to have been dear to two generations in this world?

Mrs. [Elizabeth Turner] Graham next gave us an original poem called ["]A Blessed Vision.["] It was founded on the love story in the life of the poet [John Greenleaf] Whittier. She read to us first his little poem "In School Days" telling of the school boy, and of the school girl who was sorry she spelt a word and went above him,

[141]

because her little heart had learned to love him. Mrs. Graham told us that the fact remains that he was true to her memory, that he was engaged to the same girl, who died when she was nineteen, and he was never engaged again.

Mrs. Graham's poems told of the poet dying when the lessons he had learned, and the laurels he had earned seemed to crown his life, and pure lilies and victorious palms seemed to hover over him. Then perhaps a blessed spirit who had only stood with the good in the world came to him, whose words had been lamps to those here below, came that they too might hand in hand enter into peace and joy.

Mrs. Graham told us that she had dedicated her poem to her friend: Miss [Mary F.] Grace.

Some announcements were made with regard to the next meeting. It was proposed and agreed that the announcements of the programmes of the future meetings should be posted on the door of our assembly rooms.

We then had the pleasure of receiving a letter from our former President, Mrs. [Francese Litchfield] Turnbull, to her dear friends, the President and members of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore.

It was written from York, England, and sent to and read by the Recording Secretary. Mrs. Turnbull sends the love and greeting to us as we meeust on the first Tuesday of October. She tells us that her interest in the antiquity of

[142]

the quaint old city of York cannot dim her vivid interest in her dear Club. She congratulates us upon the promise of careful and serious work of which whispers have reached her, upon the re-opening of our pleasant interviews, and upon the high standards we are all striving to maintain. She expresses her pleasure in knowing that in our President we have a Leader as faithful as she is able, and praying for us all a restful and inspiring year.

She tells us that her windows look out upon the grandest and perhaps the most satisfying Cathedral in England, and upon the curious old city walls.

After speaking of the beauty and antiquity which surrounds her she tells us she would have preferred to write from Edinburgh, which adds to the beauty of art and nature, and historic associations, the classical and intellectual charm that has given it the name of Modern Athens. She wishes our practical makers of cities with their passion for straight lines could be won by the rare picturesqueness of Edinburgh, which climbs the hillsides and bridges the chasms unconscious of any sin against propriety.

She wished for all of us there, especially for the Fiction Class, before the monument of the prince of story tellers. She described many lovely and interesting scenes, with their associations of song and story.

But the reverse of the picture is in the noisome closes or alleys, of which she

[143]

says if they are treasure ground to the historian, should be retained as historic groundalone and their inhabitants given clean homes in the smiling country that almost touches them,--all of which she thinks would have interest for our class in Economices.

She spoke of the monuments and literature commemorating the great men and great deeds belonging to Edinburgh; and thinks that we might do a great deal in our own city of Baltimore, and for our country, and make our successors mentally greatly richer for our labors.

She speaks of the Lake Country where she wished for the Artist and poets of our Club, and for all of us who are artists and poets at heart, to see the homes and haunts of many who seem to us like friends and acquaintances. She speaks of Wordsworth's cottage, which from her account seems yet to show evidence of his "plain living and high thinking."

Also of the near by grave of Miss [Anne Jemima] Clough, first principal of Newnham College, in whom she felt "a personal interest."

Mrs. Turnbull sends her love to each member of the Club and her hope for our happiness and profit during the coming year, hoping that each one will accept this as an individual letter, and if the spirit should move any of us to send her a line telling of our own welfare, our work or Club news, it would be most gladly

[144]

welcomed. Her permanent address while abroad is Brown Shipley and Co. Bankers, London, England. The rest of our evening was spent in social converse and mental and physical refreshment.
