Louise Malloy was born in 1889 in Baltimore and educated at the Academy of the Visitation. She was a journalist for the Baltimore American for many years, serving as the newspaper's theater critic; she also wrote a daily humor column under the name Josh Wink from 1903 until about 1920. She was also a playwright. Her most successful play was The Player Maid, which was reviewed highly in the Baltimore Sun as well as the American, and was produced in New York City. She was a member of the Club for the 1894-95 season and again from 1904 to 1910, where her work was very positively received. Malloy also belonged to the Woman’s Club of Roland Park. She was honored by the Baltimore branch of the National League of American Penwomen in 1939; she died in 1947.
