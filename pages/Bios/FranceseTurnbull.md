Francese Hubbard Litchfield Turnbull was born in Utica, New York in 1845. She was educated at home and in Europe. In 1871, she married Baltimore attorney Lawrence Turnbull. The Turnbulls resided in Baltimore and were the parents of five children. Turnbull was one of the founders of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore, and served as the first president of the Club, a position to which she was re-elected seven times. Turnbull and her husband were devoted to the interests of the poet Sidney Lanier, with whom they were closely acquainted. She read papers on Lanier and other literary subjects to the Club, some of which were published, and also wrote a novel based on Lanier, The Catholic Man, which was published in 1890. Turnbull was also the author of several other historical novels: *Val Maria* (1893), *The Golden Book of Venice* (1900), and *A Royal Pawn of Venice* (1911). Turnbull remained a member of the club for many years and passed away in 1927.
