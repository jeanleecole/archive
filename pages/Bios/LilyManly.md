## Lily Tyson (Mrs. Gaston) Manly (????-1924)

Lily Tyson Manly was an early member of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore, giving her first presentation in May 1892. She was the daughter of James E. Tyson, a descendant of the founding family of Ellicott City. Lily Tyson Manly Elliott was proud of her heritage and was an active member of the Colonial Dames and the Daughters of the American Revolution, serving as an officer of the national DAR. She was married twice; her first marriage to Gaston Manly ended in divorce in 1896, after which Gaston Manly committed suicide, causing a sensation that was widely reported in the Baltimore press. After the divorce, she began using her own name, Mrs. L. Tyson Manly. In 1905, she married A. Marshall Elliott, professor of Romance Languages at the Johns Hopkins University. She served as Second Vice-President of the Club for two seasons, 1895-97.
