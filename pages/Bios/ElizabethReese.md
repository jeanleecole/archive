## Elizabeth McCormick Reese (Mrs. Percy Meredith) (1849-1918)

Elizabeth ("Lizzie") McCormick Reese became a member of the WLBC in the first few years of its existence and was the longtime chair of the Committee on Fiction. She was born in Virginia in 1849 and married Percy Meredith Reese in 1872; the couple had two sons. Reese's grocery (initially Percy M. Reese, grocer, and later Percy M. Reese & Son), stood for many years at 1201 N. Charles St., one of Baltimore's main thoroughfares. The store was originally established in 1835 and was, at the time of its closing in 1913, "the oldest grocery in Baltimore" catering to "the best families in Baltimore." She died in 1918, predeceasing her husband by some five years.
